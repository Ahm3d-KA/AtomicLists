I feel like this is my first full stack application that I have made so I feel kind of proud of myself. Lots of realisations during this projects where .NET just started clicking. Rider is a very useful IDE. I know I am at the peak of mount stupid but that shows that I am becoming more competent.

- Made it look kind of cool but looks a bit bare
- Can see tasks on front page
- Can add, edit, and delete tasks
- Can mark tasks as complete 
- Can mark task with areas such as school and what priority it is
- Can see tasks in a table view
- Can see how many tasks completed and total tasks

Things to do:
- See a number of tasks in each area using pi charts
- Add a calendar to see when tasks are due
- Add different views
- See % of tasks that have been completed 
- Be able to sort and filter tasks by different categories
- Login and register
